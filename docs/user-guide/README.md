### Hiring Employees

```bash
# Basic hiring
hire <name> <role>

# Examples
hire alice developer
hire sarah designer
hire bob tester

# Hire with specific intelligence level
hire elad FS-developer smart    # Uses high-performance AI model
hire sarah designer normal      # Uses standard AI model
```

### Managing Your Team

```bash
# View all employees
status

# View specific employee details
task <name>

# Fire an employee
fire <name>

# View active sessions
sessions
```

## üéØ Task Management

### Assigning Tasks

```bash
# Basic task assignment
assign <name> "task description"

# Examples
assign elad "add a login form to the homepage"
assign sarah "improve the CSS styling for mobile devices"
assign bob "test the new authentication system"

# Assign with specific AI model
assign elad "complex refactoring task" claude-3.5-sonnet
```

### Task Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Clear, detailed descriptions work best
   ```bash
   # Good
   assign elad "add a responsive navigation menu with dropdown for mobile"
   
   # Less effective
   assign elad "fix the menu"
   ```

2. **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Large tasks work better when split
   ```bash
   assign alice "create user registration form"
   assign alice "add form validation"
   assign alice "connect form to database"
   ```

3. **Use Appropriate Employee Types**: Match tasks to skills
   ```bash
   assign sarah "improve button styling"     # Designer for UI
   assign elad "implement API endpoint"      # Developer for backend
   assign bob "test the new feature"         # Tester for QA
   ```

### Monitoring Progress

```bash
# Quick status overview
status

# Detailed task progress
task <name>

# View task file directly
cat sessions/<name>/task.md

# Check file locks
files
```

## üí¨ Chat System Integration

### Telegram Setup

For the full collaborative experience, integrate with Telegram:

1. **Set up Telegram Bot** (see [setup guide](../setup/TELEGRAM_SETUP.md))
2. **Start Chat System**
   ```bash
   chat-start
   ```

### Using Chat Commands

In your Telegram group:

```
# Assign tasks with @mentions
@elad please add a gradient background to the CSS file
@sarah can you review the mobile layout?

# Check status
/status

# Get help
@team I need help with this CSS issue
```

### Chat Best Practices

1. **Use @mentions**: Direct tasks to specific employees
2. **Be conversational**: Natural language works well
3. **Ask for help**: Use `@team` when stuck
4. **Be patient**: AI employees will respond when they complete tasks

## üîí File Management

### Understanding File Locks

OpenCode-Slack prevents conflicts by locking files during work:

```bash
# View locked files
files

# Lock files manually
lock elad "src/auth.py,src/models.py" "implementing authentication"

# Release files
release elad src/auth.py

# Request files from another employee
request elad src/auth.py "need to integrate with API"
```

### File Lock Best Practices

1. **Let the system handle locks**: Usually automatic
2. **Release when done**: Files auto-release when tasks complete
3. **Request politely**: Use descriptive reasons for file requests
4. **Avoid conflicts**: Check `files` before starting related work

## üéÆ Advanced Features

### Smartness Levels

Configure different AI models for different needs:

```bash
# View available models
