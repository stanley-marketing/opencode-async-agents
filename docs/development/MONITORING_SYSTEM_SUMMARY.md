# Agent Monitoring System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Agent Monitoring System for the OpenCode-Slack project. The system addresses the user's concern about agents stopping suddenly or getting stuck in loops by providing proactive monitoring and automatic recovery mechanisms.

## Problem Statement

The user expressed concerns about:
1. Agents stopping suddenly and not continuing work
2. Agents getting stuck in loops
3. Need for a polling system to monitor agent status
4. Need for an agent management system to restart and guide stuck agents

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a comprehensive Agent Monitoring System with the following components:

### 1. Agent Health Monitor (`src/monitoring/agent_health_monitor.py`)
- Continuously monitors agent status at configurable intervals
- Detects anomalies like stuck states and progress stagnation
- Integrates with existing AgentManager and TaskProgressTracker
- Provides health status summaries via API

### 2. Agent Recovery Manager (`src/monitoring/agent_recovery_manager.py`)
- Automatically restarts agents detected as stuck
- Sends notification messages to prompt agents to continue work
- Provides escalation mechanisms for unresolved issues
- Tracks recovery actions and history

### 3. Monitoring Dashboard (`src/monitoring/monitoring_dashboard.py`)
- Interactive CLI dashboard for real-time monitoring
- Displays agent health summaries and detailed information
- Shows recovery statistics and history
- Provides manual intervention capabilities

### 4. Server Integration (`src/server.py`)
- Automatic initialization of monitoring system
- REST API endpoints for monitoring data
- Integration with existing server components

### 5. CLI Integration (`src/cli_server.py`)
- New `monitor` and `monitor-dashboard` commands
- Interactive monitoring dashboard access
- Real-time monitoring from CLI

## Key Features

### Anomaly Detection
- **Stuck State Detection**: Identifies agents that remain in the same state for too long
- **Progress Stagnation Detection**: Detects agents not making progress on tasks
- **Error State Detection**: Monitors for agents in error or stuck states

### Automatic Recovery
- **Agent Restart**: Automatically restarts agents detected as stuck
- **Notification System**: Sends messages to prompt agents to continue work
- **Escalation Mechanism**: Handles unresolved issues that require human intervention

### Monitoring Interface
- **CLI Dashboard**: Interactive real-time monitoring interface
- **REST API**: Programmatic access to monitoring data
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and analysis

### Integration Points
- Works seamlessly with existing AgentManager
- Integrates with TaskProgressTracker for progress monitoring
- Compatible with opencode session management
- Extends existing server and CLI functionality

## Implementation Details

### Files Created
1. `src/monitoring/__init__.py` - Package initialization
2. `src/monitoring/agent_health_monitor.py` - Health monitoring component
3. `src/monitoring/agent_recovery_manager.py` - Recovery management component
4. `src/monitoring/monitoring_dashboard.py` - CLI dashboard component
5. `docs/agent-monitoring-system.md` - Documentation
6. `docs/MONITORING_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md` - This summary
7. `tests/test_agent_monitoring.py` - Test cases
8. `scripts/demo_monitoring.py` - Demo script

### Files Modified

3. `src/cli_server.py` - Added monitoring commands and dashboard access
4. `README.md` - Updated documentation to include monitoring system

## API Endpoints

The monitoring system provides the following REST API endpoints:

- `GET /monitoring/health` - Get comprehensive agent health status
- `GET /monitoring/recovery` - Get recovery statistics and history
- `GET /monitoring/agents/<agent_name>` - Get specific agent monitoring details

## CLI Commands

The monitoring system adds the following CLI commands:

- `monitor` - Display static monitoring dashboard
- `monitor-dashboard` - Interactive monitoring dashboard

## Benefits

### Proactive Issue Detection
- Automatically detects when agents become stuck or unresponsive
- Continuous monitoring prevents issues from going unnoticed
- Configurable thresholds for different types of anomalies

### Automatic Recovery
- Reduces manual intervention with automatic restart capabilities
- Notification system helps agents continue work without human intervention
- Escalation mechanisms ensure critical issues are addressed

### Real-time Visibility
- Interactive dashboard provides real-time monitoring of agent status
- REST API enables programmatic access to monitoring data
- Detailed logging supports debugging and analysis

### Seamless Integration
- Works with existing agent management infrastructure
- Extends functionality without disrupting current workflows
- Backward compatible with existing components

## Usage Examples

### Starting Server with Monitoring
```bash
python src/server.py
```

### Using CLI Monitoring
```bash
python src/cli_server.py
opencode-slack> monitor
opencode-slack> monitor-dashboard
```

### Accessing Monitoring Data via API
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/monitoring/health
curl http://localhost:8080/monitoring/recovery
curl http://localhost:8080/monitoring/agents/agent-name
```

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for monitoring system components
- Integration tests with existing agent management system
- Verification of API endpoints and CLI commands

All tests pass successfully, confirming the monitoring system works correctly.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the monitoring system:
1. Web-based dashboard for monitoring
2. Email/SMS alerting for critical issues
3. Historical analytics and trend analysis
4. Integration with external monitoring systems
5. Machine learning-based anomaly detection

## Conclusion

The Agent Monitoring System successfully addresses the user's concerns by providing proactive monitoring and automatic recovery for AI agents. The system detects when agents stop suddenly or get stuck in loops and takes corrective action to ensure reliable agent performance. With real-time monitoring, automatic recovery, and comprehensive logging, the system provides the oversight needed for robust agent management.
