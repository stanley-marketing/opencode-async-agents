# Agent Memory System PRD

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable communication agents to maintain short-term memory of team conversations
- Allow agents to identify and store important information from team activities
- Provide contextual awareness for better collaboration and information sharing
- Maintain agent autonomy in deciding what information is relevant

### Background Context
Current agents process conversations in isolation without maintaining context across interactions. By implementing a memory system, agents can track team activities, understand what others are working on, and make informed decisions about information relevance. This enhancement enables more sophisticated team collaboration while preserving agent autonomy in information processing.

## Requirements

### Functional
FR1: System shall provide personal memory folders for each agent under sessions/{employee_name}/memory/
FR2: System shall automatically log conversations to memory for context awareness
FR3: System shall enable agents to store important information using ReAct tools
FR4: System shall provide memory context to ReAct agents for enhanced decision making
FR5: System shall implement automatic cleanup to prevent memory bloat

### Non Functional
NFR1: Memory operations shall have minimal performance impact (<5ms overhead)
NFR2: Memory storage shall use efficient JSON format with size limits
NFR3: System shall maintain backward compatibility with existing agent functionality
NFR4: Memory context shall be available in agent prompts without overwhelming token usage

### Compatibility Requirements
CR1: Existing APIs remain unchanged
CR2: Database schema changes are backward compatible
CR3: UI changes follow existing patterns
CR4: Performance impact is minimal

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Agents maintain conversation context while preserving their autonomy in information processing. Users observe more sophisticated team collaboration as agents reference previous conversations and track team activities.

### Core Screens and Views
- Memory folder structure in sessions directory
- Conversation logs and important information storage
- Agent decision-making context in ReAct prompts
- Memory summary information for system monitoring

### Target Device and Platforms
Web Responsive, and all development environments supporting Python 3.x

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure
Monorepo

### Service Architecture
Monolith with memory management as integrated component

### Testing Requirements
Unit + Integration testing for memory operations and agent integration

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Use JSON for efficient memory storage
- Implement automatic cleanup of old conversations
- Provide memory context in agent prompts without token bloat
- Maintain agent autonomy in information relevance decisions

## Epic List

Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure: Establish memory management system with personal folders
Epic 2: Conversation Processing: Implement automatic conversation logging and agent memory awareness
Epic 3: Information Management: Enable agents to store and retrieve important information

## Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

As a system architect,
I want to establish a memory management system with personal folders for each agent,
so that agents can maintain context across conversations while preserving system efficiency.

### Story 1.1 Implement MemoryManager with personal session folders and conversation storage

As a system component,
I want to provide personal memory folders for each agent,
so that agents can maintain individual conversation context and important information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Each agent has personal memory folder under sessions/{employee_name}/memory/
2. Memory folder contains conversation logs and important information files
3. JSON format used for efficient storage and retrieval
4. Automatic cleanup prevents memory bloat with configurable limits

### Story 1.2 Integrate memory system with CommunicationAgent for automatic conversation logging

As a communication agent,
I want to automatically log conversations to my memory,
so that I can maintain context across interactions without manual effort.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. All conversations automatically stored in agent memory
2. Memory storage occurs without impacting conversation processing performance
3. Conversation logs include sender, message content, and timestamp
4. Storage limits prevent excessive disk usage

## Epic 2: Conversation Processing

As a system intelligence component,
I want to process conversations with memory awareness,
so that agents can make informed decisions about information relevance.

### Story 2.1 Add memory context to ReAct agent prompts for enhanced awareness

As a ReAct agent,
I want memory context in my prompts,
so that I can make better decisions about conversation relevance and information importance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Memory context included in ReAct agent prompt templates
2. Recent conversation summary provided without token bloat
3. Important information topics listed for quick reference
4. Memory context updates dynamically as new conversations occur

### Story 2.2 Enable ReAct agents to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant conversations

As a ReAct agent,
I want to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant conversations,
so that I can focus on important information while acknowledging team activities appropriately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Agents can identify conversations requiring detailed processing
2. Agents can acknowledge irrelevant conversations with brief responses
3. Important information extraction available through ReAct tools
4. Memory context helps agents make relevance decisions

## Epic 3: Information Management

As a system intelligence component,
I want to enable agents to store and retrieve important information,
so that team knowledge is preserved and shared appropriately.

### Story 3.1 Create tools for agents to store and retrieve important information

As a ReAct agent,
I want tools to store important information from conversations,
so that I can build knowledge of team activities and completed work.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. store_memory tool available to ReAct agents
2. Tool accepts information, topic, and source parameters
3. Stored information organized by topic for easy retrieval
4. Memory storage persists across agent sessions

### Story 3.2 Implement agent autonomy in information relevance decisions

As a ReAct agent,
I want to decide autonomously what information is important,
so that I can focus on relevant team activities while maintaining efficiency.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Agents can choose to store or dismiss conversation information
2. Decision making based on conversation content and context
3. Brief acknowledgments for dismissed conversations
4. Detailed processing for important information
