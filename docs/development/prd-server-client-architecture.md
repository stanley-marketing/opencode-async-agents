# Server-Client Architecture PRD

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable scalable, distributed deployment of the AI employee management system
- Provide remote access to server functionality via CLI client
- Improve process management and conflict resolution
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing monolithic CLI

### Background Context
The current system operates as a monolithic CLI server which limits scalability and deployment flexibility. By implementing a server-client architecture, we can enable multiple clients to connect to a single server instance, run components on different machines, and improve overall system management. This enhancement maintains all existing functionality while adding new deployment and access patterns.

### Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2025-08-01 | 1.0 | Initial server-client architecture PRD | System Generated |

## Requirements

### Functional
FR1: System shall provide standalone server process with REST API
FR2: System shall support CLI client connecting to remote server
FR3: System shall handle multiple concurrent client connections
FR4: System shall implement enhanced Telegram conflict detection and resolution
FR5: System shall provide graceful shutdown handling for server processes

### Non Functional
NFR1: Server-client communication shall have minimal latency (<100ms)
NFR2: REST API shall support standard HTTP methods and status codes
NFR3: System shall maintain backward compatibility with existing CLI
NFR4: Server shall support environment variable configuration (PORT, HOST)

### Compatibility Requirements
CR1: Existing APIs remain unchanged
CR2: Database schema changes are backward compatible
CR3: UI changes follow existing patterns
CR4: Performance impact is minimal

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The server-client architecture provides enterprise-grade deployment flexibility while maintaining the familiar CLI interface. Users can choose between monolithic mode or distributed deployment based on their needs.

### Core Screens and Views
- Server startup and status monitoring
- Client connection and command execution
- Health check and diagnostic information
- Configuration management interface

### Target Device and Platforms
Web Responsive, and all development environments supporting Python 3.x

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure
Monorepo

### Service Architecture
Monolith with HTTP API layer for remote access

### Testing Requirements
Unit + Integration testing for server-client communication

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Use Flask for REST API implementation
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Support standard environment variables for configuration
- Maintain all existing functionality in both modes

## Epic List

Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure: Establish server-client architecture with REST API and CLI client
Epic 2: Enhanced Process Management: Implement robust server lifecycle management and conflict resolution
Epic 3: Deployment & Configuration: Enable flexible deployment with environment variable support

## Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

As a system architect,
I want to establish a server-client architecture with REST API and CLI client,
so that the system can be deployed in distributed configurations while maintaining existing functionality.

### Story 1.1 Implement standalone server with REST API exposing all existing functionality

As a system component,
I want to expose all existing functionality via REST API,
so that remote clients can access the complete system feature set.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Server runs as standalone process with configurable host/port
2. REST API endpoints exist for all major system functions (employees, tasks, files, etc.)
3. API follows standard HTTP conventions with proper status codes
4. All existing functionality is available via API without feature loss

### Story 1.2 Create CLI client that connects to server via HTTP API

As a system user,
I want to connect to the server remotely via CLI client,
so that I can manage the system from different machines or locations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. CLI client can connect to remote server via URL configuration
2. All existing CLI commands work through client-server communication
3. Client provides clear error messages for connection issues
4. Multiple clients can connect to same server simultaneously

## Epic 2: Enhanced Process Management

As a system administrator,
I want robust process management and conflict resolution,
so that the system operates reliably in production environments.

### Story 2.1 Add enhanced Telegram conflict detection and resolution with webhook management

As a system component,
I want to automatically detect and resolve Telegram polling conflicts,
so that multiple instances can operate without manual intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System detects 409 Conflict errors from Telegram API
2. Automatic webhook clearing and conflict resolution
3. Configurable retry logic with backoff strategy
4. Clear error messages when conflicts cannot be resolved

### Story 2.2 Implement proper server shutdown handling with graceful process termination

As a system operator,
I want proper shutdown handling for clean process termination,
so that no zombie processes or resource leaks occur.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Server handles SIGTERM and SIGINT signals gracefully
2. All active connections are closed properly
3. Telegram polling stops cleanly without conflicts
4. Process exits with appropriate status codes

## Epic 3: Deployment & Configuration

As a system deployer,
I want flexible deployment with environment variable support,
so that the system can be configured for different environments.

### Story 3.1 Implement environment variable support for server configuration

As a system administrator,
I want to configure the server via environment variables,
so that deployment is simplified across different environments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. PORT environment variable configures server port
2. HOST environment variable configures server host
3. TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID for Telegram configuration
4. OPENCODE_SAFE_MODE to disable Telegram for conflict-free operation

### Story 3.2 Add launcher script for easy server/client management

As a system user,
I want easy commands to start server and client,
so that deployment and usage is simplified.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. ./run.sh server starts server with default configuration
2. ./run.sh client connects to local server
3. ./run.sh client --server <url> connects to remote server
4. Clear help and usage information provided
