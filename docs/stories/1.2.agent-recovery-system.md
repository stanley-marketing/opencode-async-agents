# Story 1.2: Implement Agent Recovery System - Brownfield Addition

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a system administrator,
I want the system to automatically recover stuck or unresponsive agents,
So that agent performance remains reliable without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System can automatically restart agents detected as stuck
2. System can send notification messages to agents to continue work
3. System can escalate issues to human operators when automatic recovery fails
4. Recovery actions are logged for audit and diagnostic purposes
5. Existing agent functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New functionality follows existing error handling patterns
7. Integration with AgentManager maintains current behavior

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create AgentRecoveryManager class in src/monitoring/agent_recovery_manager.py
  - [ ] Implement automatic restart mechanism (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Implement notification system for stuck agents (AC: 2)
- [ ] Implement recovery algorithms (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Add restart threshold configuration
  - [ ] Add notification escalation mechanism (AC: 3)
- [ ] Integrate with AgentHealthMonitor (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Add callback for detected anomalies
  - [ ] Implement recovery action execution
- [ ] Add logging for audit purposes (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Log recovery actions taken
  - [ ] Log escalation notifications
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility (AC: 5, 6, 7)
  - [ ] No changes to existing APIs
  - [ ] Follow existing error handling patterns

## Dev Notes

### Testing

- Test standards: Unit tests for recovery algorithms, integration tests for recovery actions
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: unittest framework, mock agents for testing recovery scenarios
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Test both successful recovery and escalation scenarios
