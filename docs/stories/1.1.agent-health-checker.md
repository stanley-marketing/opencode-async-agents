# Story 1.1: Implement Agent Health Checker - Brownfield Addition

## Status
InProgress

## Story
As a system administrator,
I want to continuously monitor the health status of all AI agents,
So that I can detect when agents become stuck or unresponsive.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A background monitoring service runs continuously
2. The service polls agent status at configurable intervals (default: 30 seconds)
3. Service detects when agents are stuck in the same state for too long
4. Service detects when agents are not making progress on their tasks
5. Service logs health status information for diagnostic purposes
6. Existing agent functionality continues to work unchanged
7. New functionality follows existing monitoring pattern
8. Integration with AgentManager maintains current behavior

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create AgentHealthMonitor class in src/monitoring/agent_health_monitor.py
  - [ ] Implement periodic polling mechanism (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add configuration for polling interval (AC: 2)
- [ ] Implement health check algorithms (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Add stuck state detection (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add progress stagnation detection (AC: 4)
- [ ] Integrate with existing AgentManager (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Add method to get agent status snapshots
  - [ ] Implement health status reporting
- [ ] Add logging for diagnostic purposes (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Log normal agent status
  - [ ] Log detected anomalies
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility (AC: 6, 7)
  - [ ] No changes to existing APIs
  - [ ] Follow existing code patterns

## Dev Notes

### Testing

- Test file location: tests/test_agent_health_monitor.py
- Test standards: Unit tests for health check algorithms, integration tests for monitoring service
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: unittest framework, mock agents for testing scenarios
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Test both normal operation and anomaly detection scenarios
