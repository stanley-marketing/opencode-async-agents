```

## üîí File Management & Collaboration

### File Ownership System

**Conflict Prevention:**
- Database-backed file locking prevents simultaneous edits
- Employees must request files from current owners
- Approval workflow for file transfers
- Automatic cleanup when tasks complete

**File Operations:**
```bash
# CLI commands
lock <employee> <files> "description"    # Lock files for employee
release <employee> [files]               # Release files
request <employee> <file> "reason"       # Request file access
approve <request_id>                     # Approve file request
deny <request_id>                        # Deny file request
files [employee]                         # Show locked files
```

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Lock files for elad
lock elad "src/auth.py,templates/login.html" "implementing authentication"

# Sarah needs auth.py for integration
request sarah src/auth.py "need for API integration"

# Approve the request
approve 1

# Check current file ownership
files
```

### File Request & Approval

**Automatic Requests:**
When an employee needs a file that's locked by another employee, they automatically request access:

```
elad-bot: @sarah I need access to src/auth.py for API integration. Can you release it?
sarah-bot: Sure @elad! I'm done with the authentication module. Releasing it now.
```

**Manual Approval Process:**
```bash
# View pending requests
requests

# Approve or deny
approve 1    # Approve request #1
deny 2       # Deny request #2 with reason
```

## üéÆ Advanced Features
