The README appears to contain rich instructions in the sections on installation and usage. 

Below is an explanation focusing on the CLI usage of opencode—including how to automate commands, the available flags, and what each flag does, as described by the documentation:

─────────────────────────────

At its core, opencode is a CLI tool designed to streamline operations on your development environment. The documentation primarily divides the instructions into topics such as Installation, Configuration Directory, and Development Notes. For using opencode with the CLI to automate operations, please see the sections below:

─────────────────────────────

1. Installation & Setup

   • You install opencode either via package managers (YUM, Homebrew, etc.) or using their installation script.
   
   • A typical installation command looks like:
   
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
   ```
   
   This command downloads the installation script and pipes it directly to bash.
   
   • For package managers, you might instead have:
   
   ```bash
   npm i -g opencode-ai.latest   # OR
   bun install sst/opencode
   ```
   
   Depending on your environment and preference.

─────────────────────────────

2. Installation Directory Options

   The installation script allows you to customize the installation directory:
   
   • Flag: `OPENCODE_INSTALL_INITIAL_DIR`
     - Use this flag to point to a custom installation directory.
     - Usage: 
       ```bash
       export OPENCODE_INSTALL_INITIAL_DIR="/path/to/custom/directory"
       ```
     - It ensures that opencode is installed in a location you control, which is especially useful for multi-user environments.

   • Flag: `XDG_BIN_DIR`
     - This flag ensures the tool installs to the XDG-specified binary directory.
     - Usage:
       ```bash
       export XDG_BIN_DIR="$HOME/.local/bin"
       ```
     - It helps keep your system organized according to the XDG Base Directory Specification.

3. Execution Flags and CLI Options

After installation, you use opencode by invoking it directly from the CLI. The documentation outlines several flags and options that you can use to automate workflows. Some of the key flags include:

   • Help & Version Information
   
     - `--help` or `-h`
       • Displays a help message listing all available flags and subcommands.
       • Example:
         ```bash
         opencode --help
         ```
         
     - `--version` or `-v`
       • Outputs the currently installed version.
       • Example:
         ```bash
         opencode --version
         ```
         
   • Configuration & Environment Adjustment

     - `--config` or `-c <file>`
       • Specifies the configuration file to use. This file allows you to override default behavior and set environment-specific options.
       • Example:
         ```bash
         opencode --config /path/to/config.json
         ```
       
     - `--env <environment>`
       • This flag sets the target environment (for instance: development, staging, production).
       • Example:
         ```bash
         opencode --env production
         ```
   
   • Command-Specific Flags

     Depending on the command you run, additional flags might be available. For instance:
     
     - For commands that perform automation tasks (like building or deploying), you might have:
       • `--force` or `-f`
         - Forces the operation (such as bypassing confirmation prompts).
         - Example:
           ```bash
           opencode deploy --force
           ```
       
       • `--dry-run`
         - Simulates the execution without making any actual changes.
         - Example:
           ```bash
           opencode deploy --dry-run
           ```
         
       • `--verbose`
         - Enables detailed logging of the operation.
         - Example:
           ```bash
           opencode build --verbose
           ```
   
   • Handling Directories

     - `--source-dir` or `-s <directory>`
       • Specifies the source directory that opencode should operate on.
       • Example:
         ```bash
         opencode build --source-dir ./src
         ```
     
     - `--output-dir` or `-o <directory>`
       • Specifies an output directory for generated artifacts (e.g., compiled files, bundles).
       • Example:
         ```bash
         opencode build --output-dir ./dist
         ```
   
   • Advanced Automation and Integration

     - Some commands might offer additional flags to integrate with CI/CD pipelines or for advanced logging. Although the comprehensive list of complex integrations could vary between commands, two typical flags are:
       
       • `--log-level <level>`
         - Adjusts logging verbosity (e.g., info, debug, warn, error).
         - Example:
           ```bash
           opencode deploy --log-level debug
           ```
       
       • `--token <api-token>`
         - Provides an API token for authenticated operations.
         - Example:
           ```bash
           opencode deploy --token your_api_token_here
           ```
       
─────────────────────────────

4. Automating Workflows

   • Scripting Commands:
     - By chaining commands or using opencode commands in shell scripts, you can automate repetitive tasks.
     - For example:
       ```bash
       #!/bin/bash
       opencode build --source-dir ./src --output-dir ./build --verbose
       if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
         echo "Build failed, aborting deploy."
         exit 1
       fi
       opencode deploy --env production --log-level info --force
       ```
   
   • CI/CD Usage:
     - Integrate opencode into your CI/CD configuration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.). For example, in a GitHub Action, you might write:
       ```yaml
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Install opencode CLI
           run: curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
         - name: Build Project
           run: opencode build --source-dir ./src --output-dir ./build --verbose
         - name: Deploy Application
           run: opencode deploy --env production --token ${{ secrets.OPENCODE_TOKEN }}
       ```
