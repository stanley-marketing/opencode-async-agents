# Project Root Isolation Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This enhancement adds configurable project root directories with file system isolation to enable multi-project support and enhanced security in the opencode-slack system.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Project Root Configuration
- Environment variable support (`PROJECT_ROOT`)
- REST API endpoints for runtime configuration
- CLI commands for easy management

### 2. File Path Resolution
- All file operations resolved relative to project root
- File paths stored as relative paths in database
- API responses return relative paths for consistency
- Security enforcement to prevent operations outside project root

### 3. Multi-Project Support
- Run multiple server instances for different projects
- Isolated file operations per project directory
- Backward compatibility with existing relative paths

## Technical Implementation

### Core Changes
1. **Configuration System**: Added `PROJECT_ROOT` setting in `src/config/config.py`
2. **File Ownership Manager**: Updated `src/managers/file_ownership.py` to resolve paths against project root
3. **Server API**: Added new endpoints in `src/server.py` for project root management
4. **Client Interface**: Added commands in `src/client.py` for project root configuration
5. **Opencode Wrapper**: Updated session management to use project root context

### API Endpoints
- `GET /project-root` - Get current project root directory
- `POST /project-root` - Set project root directory

### CLI Commands
- `project-root` - Show current project root directory
- `project-root <path>` - Set project root directory

## Documentation Updates

### New Documents Created
- `docs/epics/project-root-isolation-epic.md` - Epic for project root functionality
- `docs/prd-project-root.md` - Product Requirements Document for the enhancement

### README Updates
- Added `PROJECT_ROOT` to environment variables section
- Added `project-root` command to CLI commands section
- Added project root API endpoints to REST API examples

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Security**: All file operations constrained within project root
2. **Multi-Project Support**: Run multiple instances for different projects
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing relative paths continue to work
4. **Easy Configuration**: Environment variables, API, and CLI support
5. **Isolated Workspaces**: Each project has its own isolated file system context

## Testing

The implementation was tested with:
1. Setting project root via API
2. Verifying file locking works with resolved paths
3. Confirming files are properly constrained within project root
4. Testing backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Integration

The enhancement integrates seamlessly with existing components:
- File ownership management continues to work correctly
- Task progress tracking uses resolved paths
- Opencode session management respects project root constraints
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
