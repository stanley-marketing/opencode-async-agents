# Server-Client Architecture - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement a server-client architecture pattern to enable scalable, distributed deployment of the AI employee management system with improved process management and conflict resolution.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Monolithic CLI server with integrated Telegram polling, employee management, task execution
- Technology stack: Python 3.x, Flask, SQLite, Telegram API
- Integration points: FileOwnershipManager, TaskProgressTracker, CommunicationAgent, AgentBridge

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Standalone server process with REST API, CLI client for remote connection, improved process management, enhanced Telegram conflict resolution
- How it integrates: Server exposes all existing functionality via HTTP API, client provides remote access without changing core business logic
- Success criteria: System can run server and client on different machines, multiple clients can connect to one server, Telegram conflicts are automatically resolved

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Implement standalone server with REST API exposing all existing functionality
2. **Story 2:** Create CLI client that connects to server via HTTP API
3. **Story 3:** Add enhanced Telegram conflict detection and resolution with webhook management
4. **Story 4:** Implement proper server shutdown handling with graceful process termination

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Server-client communication could introduce latency or reliability issues
- **Mitigation:** Implement robust error handling, connection retry logic, and clear status reporting
- **Rollback Plan:** Revert to monolithic CLI server and disable new server-client features

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features
