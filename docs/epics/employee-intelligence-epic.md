# Employee Intelligence - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement intelligent task analysis and autonomous work capabilities for employees to enable self-management and collaboration.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: File ownership system with request/approval workflow, task progress tracking
- Technology stack: Python 3.x, SQLite, Markdown
- Integration points: FileOwnershipManager, TaskProgressTracker

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Intelligent file requirement analysis, automatic task completion detection, self-file release capabilities
- How it integrates: Enhanced employee capabilities that work with existing file ownership and progress tracking systems
- Success criteria: Employees can request additional files as needed, detect their own task completion, automatically update progress, and release files when work is complete

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Implement intelligent file requirement analysis using opencode output parsing
2. **Story 2:** Add automatic progress updates and task completion detection
3. **Story 3:** Create self-file release mechanism when work is complete

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Autonomous features may make incorrect decisions about file management
- **Mitigation:** Implement approval workflows and human oversight for critical operations
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable autonomous features and revert to manual file management

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features
