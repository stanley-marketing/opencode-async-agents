# Testing and Reliability - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Add comprehensive testing and reliability features to ensure system stability and fault tolerance.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: File ownership system with comprehensive test coverage, task progress tracking
- Technology stack: Python 3.x, SQLite, Markdown, unittest framework
- Integration points: FileOwnershipManager, TaskProgressTracker, CLI Server

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Integration tests for opencode session execution, end-to-end workflow testing, fault tolerance for opencode session failures
- How it integrates: Enhanced testing capabilities that work with existing test framework and continuous integration
- Success criteria: System handles opencode session failures gracefully, comprehensive test coverage for new features, reliable operation under stress

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Add integration tests for opencode session execution and process management
2. **Story 2:** Implement end-to-end workflow testing with real opencode commands
3. **Story 3:** Create fault tolerance mechanisms for opencode session failures with retry and recovery

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** New testing requirements could slow development velocity
- **Mitigation:** Implement parallel testing and selective test execution for development workflows
- **Rollback Plan:** Maintain existing test suite and add new tests incrementally

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features
