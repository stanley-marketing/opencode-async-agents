# Project Root Isolation - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement configurable project root directories with file system isolation to enable multi-project support and enhanced security.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: File ownership system with SQLite database, task progress tracking with markdown files, CLI server for local testing
- Technology stack: Python 3.x, SQLite, subprocess management
- Integration points: FileOwnershipManager, TaskProgressTracker, CLI Server, REST API

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Configurable project root directory with file path resolution and isolation, REST API endpoints for project root management, CLI commands for project root configuration
- How it integrates: Project root configuration works alongside existing file ownership and progress tracking systems, with all file operations resolved relative to the configured project root
- Success criteria: System can be configured to work in different project directories, all file operations are constrained within the project root, multiple server instances can work on different projects simultaneously

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Implement project root configuration with environment variable and API support
2. **Story 2:** Create file path resolution system that resolves relative paths against project root
3. **Story 3:** Add REST API endpoints and CLI commands for project root management

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Incorrect file path resolution could lead to files being accessed outside intended directories
- **Mitigation:** Implement strict path validation and sandboxing to ensure all file operations remain within project root
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable project root isolation and revert to fixed working directory if issues arise

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features
