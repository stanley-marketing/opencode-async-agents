# Monitoring and Analytics - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement comprehensive monitoring and analytics to track system performance and employee productivity.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Task progress tracking with markdown files, comprehensive logging
- Technology stack: Python 3.x, SQLite, logging framework
- Integration points: TaskProgressTracker, FileOwnershipManager, CLI Server

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Performance monitoring for opencode sessions, employee productivity analytics, system health dashboards
- How it integrates: Enhanced monitoring capabilities that work with existing logging and progress tracking systems
- Success criteria: Real-time visibility into system performance, actionable insights on employee productivity, proactive issue detection

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Implement performance monitoring and metrics collection for opencode sessions
2. **Story 2:** Create employee productivity analytics with trend analysis and reporting
3. **Story 3:** Develop system health dashboards with real-time status and alerting

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Monitoring overhead could impact system performance
- **Mitigation:** Implement efficient metrics collection with sampling and batching
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable detailed monitoring and revert to basic logging if performance impact is excessive

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features
