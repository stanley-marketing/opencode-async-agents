# Project Structure Documentation - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Create comprehensive documentation for the opencode-slack project structure to help developers understand the system architecture and component relationships.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: The opencode-slack system manages multiple AI "employees" working in parallel with proper file ownership and task tracking
- Technology stack: Python 3.x, SQLite, Markdown
- Integration points: FileOwnershipManager, TaskProgressTracker, CLI Server, SlackBot Framework

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Detailed documentation of the project structure with component descriptions and usage examples
- How it integrates: Documentation will be added to the docs/ directory following existing patterns
- Success criteria: Developers can understand the system architecture and component relationships from the documentation

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Document the directory layout and file organization of the opencode-slack project
2. **Story 2:** Create detailed component descriptions for each major system component
3. **Story 3:** Add usage examples and getting started instructions for developers

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Documentation may become outdated as the system evolves
- **Mitigation:** Include version information and regular review process
- **Rollback Plan:** Revert to previous documentation version if needed

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features
