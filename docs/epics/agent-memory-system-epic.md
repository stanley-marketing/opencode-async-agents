# Agent Memory System - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement short-term memory management for communication agents to enable contextual awareness of team conversations and collaborative information sharing.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Communication agents with ReAct reasoning, conversation handling, task assignment
- Technology stack: Python 3.x, LangChain, ReAct agents, Telegram API
- Integration points: CommunicationAgent, ReActAgent, MessageParser

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Personal memory folders for each agent, conversation logging, important information tracking, memory-aware ReAct prompts
- How it integrates: MemoryManager integrates with CommunicationAgent and ReActAgent to provide contextual awareness
- Success criteria: Agents can track team activities, identify important information, and maintain conversation context for better collaboration

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Implement MemoryManager with personal session folders and conversation storage
2. **Story 2:** Integrate memory system with CommunicationAgent for automatic conversation logging
3. **Story 3:** Add memory context to ReAct agent prompts for enhanced awareness
4. **Story 4:** Create tools for agents to store and retrieve important information

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Memory storage could consume excessive disk space or impact performance
- **Mitigation:** Implement memory limits, automatic cleanup, and efficient storage formats
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable memory features and revert to basic conversation handling

## Definition of Done
