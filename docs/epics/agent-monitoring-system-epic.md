# Agent Monitoring System - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement a comprehensive agent monitoring and management system that detects stuck or looping agents, automatically restarts them when needed, and provides real-time status oversight to ensure reliable agent performance in the OpenCode-Slack system.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context:

- Current relevant functionality: The system already has basic agent status tracking through `AgentManager` and `TaskProgressTracker` but lacks proactive monitoring
- Technology stack: Python with existing agent management infrastructure
- Integration points: Integrates with `AgentManager`, `CommunicationAgent`, `TaskProgressTracker`, and `OpencodeSessionManager`

### Enhancement Details:

- What's being added/changed: A new monitoring layer that periodically checks agent health, detects anomalies, and takes corrective actions
- How it integrates: Runs as a background service that monitors existing agent components without disrupting current workflows
- Success criteria: 
  - Agents that get stuck or loop are automatically detected within 30 seconds
  - Stuck agents are automatically restarted or notified to continue
  - System administrators can view real-time agent status through a monitoring dashboard
  - No impact on existing agent functionality or performance

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Implement Agent Health Checker - Create a background service that periodically polls agent status and detects anomalies like stuck states or infinite loops
2. **Story 2:** Implement Agent Recovery System - Develop automatic restart and notification mechanisms for agents that are detected as stuck or unresponsive
3. **Story 3:** Create Monitoring Dashboard - Build a CLI dashboard that displays real-time agent status, health metrics, and allows manual intervention

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Monitoring system could interfere with normal agent operations or create performance bottlenecks
- **Mitigation:** Implement monitoring as a lightweight background service with configurable polling intervals
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable the monitoring service through configuration without affecting core agent functionality

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features

## Story Manager Handoff

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running Python agent management infrastructure
- Integration points: AgentManager, CommunicationAgent, TaskProgressTracker, and OpencodeSessionManager
- Existing patterns to follow: Observer pattern for monitoring, existing agent status tracking approaches
- Critical compatibility requirements: Non-intrusive monitoring, configurable behavior, backward compatibility
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering comprehensive agent monitoring capabilities."
