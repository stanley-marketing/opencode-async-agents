# Communication and Coordination - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement inter-employee communication and notification systems to enable collaboration and real-time updates.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: File ownership system with request/approval workflow, task progress tracking
- Technology stack: Python 3.x, SQLite, Markdown
- Integration points: FileOwnershipManager, TaskProgressTracker

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Message passing between employees, real-time notifications for task events, collaborative workspaces
- How it integrates: Enhanced communication capabilities that work with existing file ownership and progress tracking systems
- Success criteria: Employees can communicate directly, receive real-time updates on task events, and collaborate in shared workspaces

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Implement message passing system between employees with task handoff mechanisms
2. **Story 2:** Create real-time notification system for task events and progress updates
3. **Story 3:** Develop collaborative workspaces for shared tasks with conflict resolution

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Communication overhead could impact system performance
- **Mitigation:** Implement efficient messaging with batching and prioritization
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable enhanced communication features and revert to basic request/approval workflow

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
