# Session Management - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Create isolated opencode sessions per employee with persistence and monitoring capabilities to support concurrent work.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: File ownership system with SQLite database, task progress tracking with markdown files
- Technology stack: Python 3.x, SQLite, subprocess management
- Integration points: FileOwnershipManager, TaskProgressTracker, CLI Server

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Isolated opencode sessions per employee with persistence across system restarts and health monitoring
- How it integrates: Session management will work alongside existing file ownership and progress tracking systems
- Success criteria: Each employee has isolated session environment, sessions persist across restarts, and health monitoring prevents resource leaks

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Create isolated opencode sessions per employee with resource isolation
2. **Story 2:** Implement session persistence and resumption across system restarts
3. **Story 3:** Add session monitoring and health checks with automatic cleanup

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Session resource leaks could consume system resources over time
- **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive resource cleanup and monitoring
- **Rollback Plan:** Revert to shared execution environment if session management fails

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features
