- [ ] Implement interactive task management
- [ ] Create reporting and analytics views
- [ ] Add configuration management interface

## Quick Start Implementation

### Day 1-2: Basic Execution
```python
# src/utils/opencode_wrapper.py
import subprocess

def run_opencode_task(employee_name, task_description):
    """Run a simple opencode task"""
    cmd = [
        "opencode", "run",
        "--model", "openrouter/google/gemini-2.5-pro",
        "--mode", "plan",
        task_description
    ]
    
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result
```

### Day 3-4: Task Integration
```python
# Modify task_assigner.py
def assign_task(self, employee_name, task_description):
    # Run the actual opencode task
    result = run_opencode_task(employee_name, task_description)
    
    # Parse output to determine files affected
    files_affected = parse_files_from_output(result.stdout)
    
    # Lock those files automatically
    self.file_manager.lock_files(employee_name, files_affected, task_description)
    
    # Update progress tracking
    self.task_tracker.create_task_file(employee_name, task_description, files_affected)
```

### Day 5-7: Progress Tracking
```python
# src/trackers/task_progress.py
def update_from_opencode_output(self, employee_name, opencode_output):
    """Update progress based on actual opencode output"""
    # Parse completion percentage from output
    progress_percent = parse_progress_from_output(opencode_output)
    
    # Update task file with real progress
    self.update_file_status(employee_name, "*", progress_percent, "Working...")
```

## Testing Strategy
