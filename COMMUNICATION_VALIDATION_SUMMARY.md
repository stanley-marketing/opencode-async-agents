2. **Status Tracking Inconsistency:** Agent status updates work but agent lookup fails

### Minor Issues
1. **Test Coverage:** Some edge cases in concurrent operations need more testing
2. **Documentation:** Agent initialization process needs clearer documentation

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Fix Agent Discovery:** Implement automatic communication agent creation when employees are hired
2. **Improve Agent Initialization:** Ensure AgentManager properly tracks all hired employees
3. **Enhance Status Synchronization:** Align file manager and agent manager employee tracking

### Short-term Improvements (Priority 2)
1. **Optimize Performance:** Consider message batching for higher throughput scenarios
2. **Enhance Monitoring:** Add more detailed health metrics for agent communication
3. **Improve Error Handling:** Better error messages for agent-related failures

### Long-term Enhancements (Priority 3)
1. **Scalability:** Implement connection pooling for high-load scenarios
2. **Advanced Features:** Add message queuing for offline agent handling
3. **Analytics:** Implement communication metrics dashboard
